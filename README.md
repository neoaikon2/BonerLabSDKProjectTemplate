# Bonerlab SDK Project Template

A simple drag-and-drop project template to quickly get up and running with the BonerLab SDK. Just download a zip file of this archive and extract it into a project folder of your choice, and open with Unity 2021.3.5!

## Disclaimer

Stress Level Zero's Official Bonelab SDK is MIT licenced, and by extension, so is all of this. Updates to the official SDK may break this repo at any time and there is no guaranteed support, so use at your own risk. With any luck, updates to the Official SDK will make extension repos like this obsolete.

This repo only has dummy scripts and basic data to get people started; it deliberately does not have any art, code implementation, or other IP from the Bonelab game or elsewhere. There is nothing useful here that can be used outside of Bonelab modding, and will be kept that way.
